<h1> Research Statement </h1>
    <p>
        My Research uses statistical signal processing techniques on human brain images to draw inferences of
        affective/Social-emotional processing. Currently developing a mechanistic model for longitudinal morphological
        changes of gray matter, I analyze data from a longitudinal community sample from youth ages 14-19
        who attend schools in urban Los Angeles Unified School District.
